# About Self-Built Copies
These restrictions only apply on officially distributed versions of Shukofukurou. To create an unofficial version without restrictions, build the App Store scheme. There is no software updates if you build your own as this is an unofficial copy. Do not create issues for self-built copies as they won't be supported. 

There will be a community scheme to allow users to build unofficial copies. However, you must enter your own client keys.

# Tests
Currently, there is a UI test that tests the basic UI functionality (search, adding/modifying/deleting titles, and viewing title information) and unit tests testing the search and list management functionality. Note that you should only run these tests on a test account so your entries won't get overwritten.
